# face-recognition-and-detection-opencv-and-python
I tried a program to detect faces using a webcam. It was quite successful in detecting faces. Used haar cascade provided by openCV. Straight faces get detected correctly. But inclined faces do not get detected so well. I'm guessing the features extracted in haar cascade are not rotation invariant.
